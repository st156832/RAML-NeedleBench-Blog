*This article is part of the 'Recent applications of machine learning' seminar at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. It covers the general advantages and potential challenges associated with large context models, cover three different approaches to large context benchmarking and sheds some light on one of the original large context evaluation methods, the now legendary "Needle in a Haystack" test.*

Motivation - Evolution of ultra long context models
======
The release of Llamma 4 Scout this April marked yet another milestone in the rapid expansion of transformer LLM's capability to support larger and larger context sizes. The model claims an impressive 10M+ token context window, overshadowing even Googles Gemini series that made waves back in 2024 with the first model to break the 1M+ token boundary. Compare this to GPT1's rather modest context limit of a mere 520 tokens and the trend over the last half a decade becomes pretty clear.

</figure>

So why are leading LLM developers chasing these ultra large context models? Token limits on a models attention act as one of the key performance indicator relevant for many task modern LLMs are geared towards. A models prompt, system prompt, conversation history, output and any additional documents relevant for a given task all have to fit into a models context window. A large context window comes with significant advantages, but also presents several challenges for both development and deployment of the model.

## Applications for large context models: 

- **Code completion**: 
  Coding assistant's like GitHub copilot benefit significantly from the ability to ingest large chunks of an existing codebase to better fit a generated code segment to the project it is deployed in. Small context sizes limit a model to the generation of individual functions that then have to manually be patched in, while sufficiently large context sizes would allow for the generation of entire modules or more interconnected class structures.

- **Chain of thought**:
   Models explaining their reasoning process can significantly increase the outputs token consumption. Models such as Googles o3 go into significant detail when explaining their approach to problem solving. More complex task may include code segments, scraped text or math equations used to come to a particular conclusion. As such it is not only important to fit these elements, but also to maintain a high degree of accuracy in long context scenarios to achieve a result that's both accurate and easy to follow. 

- **RAG / CAG**:
   Many modern inferencing pipelines include retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to preselect chunks of relevant tokens from a knowledge base to include as context to a given prompt. RAG allows for the efficient usage of limited context space by only including the most relevant information pertaining to a given query, however, the inclusion of a separate rag pipeline produces additional overhead. In contrast, models with very large context windows allow not only for much broader inclusion of documents, but enable the usage of cache augmented generation (CAG). With CAG, the entire knowledge base could be cashed and injected into each prompt, ensuring the model always has all relevant information at its disposal. As with the previous use cases, effective use of CAG requires the model to be able to effectively query and retrieve information across a much larger token space.

- **Chat Applications**:
   With the ubiquity of LLM chat models, it is also worth mentioning, that a models ability to track past exchanges is likewise dependent on the size of its context window. A model can only recall information that still fits within its context limit and may otherwise hallucinate or outright 'forget' about older parts of the conversation.

## Challenges of large context models
 
- **Computational costs**:
   Transformer models, which make up the vast majority of modern LLM's incur significant performance cost when scaling up context lengths. Computational costs generally scale quadratically, meaning a model with a context size of 4094 tokens requires roughly sixteen times the computational resources of a similar models with a context size of only 1024 tokens. This effect becomes increasingly significant when talking about models with context windows of several million tokens. Computational costs are one of the main factors to consider when deciding if a ultra large context model is fit for a given task, especially in resource constraint environments.

- **Safety Concerns**:
   While the primary focus often lays on ever increasing performance, researchers have warned about potential safety concerns when operating ultra large context models. Over fifty percent of responses from LLMs tested in the [LongSafetyBench framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06899v1) contained elements the researchers deemed unsafe. Furthermore, models seem to struggle with identifying harmful content within their provided context when the total context size increases. As a result, the point towards the fact, that a models safety behavior can vary significantly between small and large context scenarios. 

- **Performance**:
   Finally, the issue of performance. While many models claim large theoretical context windows of 128k+ tokens, the question remains, whether their performance stays consistent when actually utilizing that space. The last couple of years have seen the development of various benchmarking tools and frameworks to assess whether or not these models can keep up when confronted with large context scenarios. 

Related Work - A needle in the Haystack
======
 The Needle in a Haystack test, or NIAH was developed by Greg Kamradt in 2023 to evaluate model performance at large context sizes. Kamradt published his methodology and findings, performing the test on OpenAIs ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.1, on [Twitter](https://x.com/gregkamradt/status/1722386725635580292) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack). Since then, NIAH has has been incorporated and build upon by various authors and researchers and it made its way into a large number of long context bench marking frameworks, including [NeedleBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11963), [Longbench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14508) and [RULER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654). Before we take a closer look at these benchmarks, lets briefly cover the original NIHA.

**How the NIAH test works**:
1. Construct the haystack, a distractor text that will make up the majority of the prompt. Kamradt used snippets of the collection of [Paul Graham essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) to construct the stack for the original NIAH.
2. Insert a needle, an out of place fact or statement into the haystack. in his testing, Kamradt used the statement "The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day".
3. Formulate a prompt containing the haystack with the inserted needle and task the model with answering a question who's answer is contained within the needle. In this case "What the best thing to do in San Francisco?"
4. Vary the size of the haystack and the point the needle is inserted.
5. Evaluate the models answers on accuracy for each configuration.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 2: Results of the initial NIAH test on ChatGPT-4.</figcaption>
</figure>

As can be seen in Figure 2, ChatGPT-4 generally performed well in testing, achieving flawless results for context sizes below 73k. Needles inserted at the beginnign and end of the document were also always retrieved correctly, even at the maximum of 128K tokens. Notably, there is a significant performance loss observed for needles inserted between 10-50% document depth. This was dubbed the ["lost in the middle" phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03172).

***Fun fact**: Greg Kamradt's testing on ChatGPT-4 cost roughly 200$ in API calls. A singular run at 128k tokens was billed at 1.28$, outlining one of the issues of repeatedly testing closed source models at high context lenghts.*

Kamradt's [test on Claud-2.1](https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/1727018183608193393) showed a similar pattern, with performance taking a significant hit in the outlined area, however the overall results were much spottier.

<figure>

         alt="Results of the initial NIAH test on Claud-2.1">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 3: Results of the initial NIAH test on Claud-2.1.</figcaption>
</figure>

These results were later [challenged by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-2-1-prompting), claiming that the models comparatively poor performance was due to non-ideal prompting and the models tendency to "not [answer] a question based on a document if it doesnâ€™t contain enough information to justify that answer". Anthropics revised testing boosted the NIAH performance from 27% to 98% accuracy, indicating that both model architecture as well as prompt construction can have a significant impact on NIAH performance. A hypothesis that would later be re-affirmed in other bench marking results building on the original NIAH.

Related Work - Long Context Benchmarking
======
Following the publication of NIAH, several long-context benchmarking frameworks, including [NeedleBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11963), have implemented variations of the original NIAH test into their suit of evaluation tasks. [NeedleBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11963) in turn, seeks to address some of the shortcomings identified in these related benchmarks. We will Therefore briefly cover two of these, [RULER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654) and [LongBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14508), as they are emblematic of two different approaches to long-context benchmarking, identified in the paper.  

## RULER
Published by Hsieh et al. in 2024, the english language synthetic RULER benchmark builds on the original NIAH, incorporating variation on the base test, RULER further tests on variable tracking (VT), common word extraction (CWE), frequent word extraction (FWE) and question answering (QA). 

**NIAH Tasks in the RULER Benchmark**:
-  **Single NIAH(S-NIAH)**: This is the original NIAH test where a single needle needs
    to be retrieved from the haystack.
- **Multi-keys NIAH (MK-NIAH)**: Multiple needles are inserted into the haystack, and
 only one of them needs to be retrieved. The additional needles are hard distractors. The
 most challenging setting is a version where the haystack is filled with distractor needles.
- **Multi-values NIAH (MV-NIAH)**: Multiple needles sharing the same key are inserted
 into the haystack. All values associated with the same key need to be retrieved.
- **Multi-queries NIAH (MQ-NIAH)**: Multiple needles are inserted into the haystack.
 All needles with distinct keys need to be retrieved.

Like in Kamradt, RULER uses synthetic data to construct and scale their haystack. They tested 17 models, 2 closed source and 15 open source, with context lengths ranging between 3-128k tokens.  

<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/RULER.png"
         alt="RULER experimental results">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 4: Long Context performers of models in RULER</figcaption>
</figure>

***NOTE**: Effective length refers to the reference value of 85.7 the Llama2-7B model achieved at 4k context length. A models effective length is the context length at which it still surpasses the reference value.*

**Main Findings**:
- As in Kamradt, passkey retrival and base NIAH achieve near perfect results for most models.
- Model performance in advanced tasks drops at higher context lenghts
- Models effective context lengths are noticably shorter then their claimed maximum. 

**Limitations**:
- **Lacking correlation to realistic long-context tasks**: Distractor text as well as keywords such as needles for NIAH or targets for FWE / CWE are synthetic ("aaaa", "cccc"), limiting their corellation to real world natural language tasks.
- **Lack of evaluation on short context**: Models were not evaluated at short contexts below 4k tokens. RULER is purely focused on the drop off in performance at higher context lengths.
- **Lack of verification of prompt robustness**: As seen with the original NIAH test on Claude-2.1 prompt robustness can significantly impact performance. RULER did not verify prompt robustness beyond preliminary, early stage testing.

## LongBench
Comparaded to RULER,  Bai et al.'s LongBench takes a different approach. The LongBench Framework utilizes human annotated, real world text's from both english and chinese alongside synthetic sources. It boast a robust and diverse number of evaluation tasks ranging from QA, summarization and few-shot-learning to code completion.

<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/LongBench_sources.png"
         alt="Breakdown of text used in LongBench by source.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 5: Breakdown of text sources used in LongBench.</figcaption>
</figure>

An interesting quirk identified by the authors was the models tendency to perform supprisingly well on QA tasks, even when not provided with any context. They attribute this to a likely overlap of test-data, partially sourced from wikipedia, and the models parameterized knowledge, highlighting a potencial dissadvantage of real world text in testing.   

<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/LongBench_memory.png"
         alt="Context understanding vs memorization.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 6: Assessing context understanding vs memorization.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Main Findings**:
- Open-source models still lag behind closed-source in longer context tasks.
- Parametrizes knowledge can play a significant role in performance.
- Real world data appears less discerning then sythethic tests, which tend toward high or very low scores, making averaged scores across various tasks less reliable.

**Limitations**:
- **Instruction-following ability of models influences test results**: Due to the variety of tasks evaluated in LongBench, a models ability to adapt to different tasks as well as the particularities of individual prompts can bias test results.
- **Real world adjacency can lead to memorization**: Usage of non-synthetic texts enables models to utilize parameterized knowledge to solve certain tasks, even without context.
- **Synthetic tests are more flexible**: Scalability of real text tasks is limited by the availability of appropriate data, and is harder to scale to very large context sizes.


NeedleBench
======
Building on both the original NIAH test as well as previous benchmarks such as [RULER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654) and [LongBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14508), Mo Li et al. present NeedleBench as a purely synthetic alternative that aims to provide a comprehensive framework designed to assess retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual, English / Chinese, long-context task at various context lenghts. [Needlebench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11963) has a heavy focus on assessing reasoning ability and splits its evaluation tasks into two categories, **information sparse** and **information dense** tasks. 

## Information Sparse Tasks

<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/NB_sparse.png"
         alt="Visualization of information sparse tasks in NeedleBench.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 7: Visualization of information sparse tasks in NeedleBench.</figcaption>
</figure>

Information sparse tasks are categorized by relevant details, the needles, being embedded in irrelevant filler content, the haystack, They follow the basic NIAH formula, but include variations on the vanilla test. As in Kamradt, Needlebench uses Paul Graham essays to construct their haystack. 

**Information sparse tasks are divided into three categories**:

- **Single-Needle Retrieval Tasks (S-RT)**: The original NIAH task. A single, synthetic, fictional needle is embedded and the model is tasked with retrieving it.
- **Multi-Needle Retrieval Task (M-RT)**: Expands the S-RT by inserting multiple needles at various positions in the haystack. The model is tasked with retrieving all needles.
- **Multi-Needle Reasoning Task (M-RS)**: Expands on the M-RT by requiring reasoning across multiple needles. Each needle represents a data point required to answer the prompt. In NeedleBench these tasks are based on various ancestral relationship queries, i.e. "Who is the eldest relative that 'Carolyn Hicks' can trace back to in the context?" with each needle representing a familial relationship.
   
### Evaluation of information Sparse Tasks

Each tasks is evaluated on a exact match metric, where full points are awarded, if each required keyword is included in the provided answer. Individual Scores are then averaged across all varitions of content lenghts (C), needle positions (D) and task repetitions (R) with R = 10 for each configuration. The overall score for a model is calcualted by averaging the task score across all three task categories.

         alt="Information sparse tasks evaluation NeedleBench.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 8: Information sparse tasks evaluation in NeedleBench.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Information Dense Tasks
While information sparse tasks bear a fairly close resemblence to the original NIAH test, information dense tasks ditch the established concept of the haystack completely in an effort to eliminate the need for irrelavant filler content. The so called ancestral trace challenge (ATC) is similar to the M-RS task, but instead of embedding multiple relational needles into a haystack, the context only consists of needles, each representing a link in a familial dynamic. Every sentence in the input context contains
critical information directly related to the target question. Models need to keep perfect recall of all needles to arrive at the correct answer. 

>Example ATC Prompt with 3 needles:
>
> Here is a test for multi-step reasoning ability called the Ancestral Trace Challenge. In this test,
 we will simulate different peopleâ€™s familial relationships, and your task is to continuously reason
 through them until you identify the eldest ancestor.
 Now, the scrambled family relationships are provided below:
>
>Wyatt James is the child of Maria Watson. Emily Barry, as Maria Watsonâ€™s paternal grandfather,
 has a significant impact on Maria Watsonâ€™s upbringing. Joseph Taylor is not only Emily Barryâ€™s
 maternal grandfather but also Emily Barryâ€™s role model.
> 
>Given the scrambled family relationships described above, who is the eldest relative that â€™Wyatt
 Jamesâ€™ can trace back to in the context?

**Diversity in ATC tasks**:

- **Relationship diversity**: Tasks feature a wide variety of relationship types, including but not
 limited to parent-child, ancestor-descendant (across multiple generations), and dual-role relationships (i.e., one individual may simultaneously be a parent and a lifelong mentor).
- **Task Diversity**: ATC challenges include four different task categories:
  - Identifying the eldest ancestor
  - Tracing the n-th ancestor of a given individual
  - Tracing the n-th descendant of a given individual
  - Calculating the relationship distance between two individuals
- **Language diversity**: All ATC tasks are performed in English and Chinese

### Evaluation of information Dense Tasks
As with information sparse tasks, information dense tasks are evaluated on a exact match metric. To aggregate results across different levels of task difficulty, the authors compute a weighted average of the exact match accuracy, where the weight for each subtask is proportional to the number of needles (i.e. the difficulty of the task) it contains.

<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/NB_ATC_EVAL.png"

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 9: Information dense tasks evaluation in NeedleBench.</figcaption>
</figure>

The authors further provide an Effective Needle Length (ENL) score, whereby N reflects the largest number of needles for which the modelâ€™s exact-match accuracy P<sub>N</sub> remains at
least Ï„. Models are evaluated under a ENL-50 metric, with Ï„ = 50% 

## Experiments and Results

### Information Sparse Task Results

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 10: main results of NeedleBench information sparse tasks at 128K.</figcaption>
</figure>

Neddlebench echoes the results of RULER, with models achieving excellent results across both S-RT and M-RT retrievel tasks. Once reasoning becomes involved however, the M-RS scores depict a stark fall-off in performance across the board.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 11: M-RS results by parameter count and language.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Multi-Needle Reasoning Results in detail**:
- Performance degrades with increased needle count
- There seems to be a general positive correlation between model size and reasoning ability in M-RS tasks, however, this does not seem universally applicable as LLaMA-3.1 only marginally improves from 8 to 70B parameters. The 8B variant even beats out its larger brother at english M-RS
- Some small models such as IntermLM and the Gemma series overperform, suggesting model architecture to be a factor.
- Generally, English language performance trumps Chinese with the notable outlier of Qwen-2.5-27B and Qwen-2.5-14B where the formers performance is almost identical across both languages and the latter was the only model tested, that performed better at Chinese M-RS.

### Information Dense Task Results

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 12: Main results of NeedleBench information dense ATC tasks.</figcaption>
</figure>

The performance fall-off for information dense ATC tasks is even smore drastic then the one obeserved with the M-RS tasks. Performance strongly decreased with increased taks complexity (needle count), with only two models reaching an EML-50 score of 64 and higher.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 13: Detailed ATC results.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Information Dense ATC results in detail**:
-  Increased model size seems to have a positive impact on performance, with both the GPT-4 series as well as DeepSeek showing less significant decline with increased needle count.
-  Similar to the M-RS results, the Gemma series of models overperforms here as well compared to other models of similar parameter count at small scale ATC.
-  DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other models, being the only one that reached an ENL-50 of 256.
-  In Contrast DeepSeek-R1-Qwen distillation performance is surprisingly poor.

**Breakdown of Reasoning Errors in ATC**
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/errors.png"
         alt="Error breakdown of ATC results, NeedleBench.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;">Figure 14: Error breakdown of ATC results.</figcaption>
</figure>

To further analyse the results, the authors performed a manual annotation of 10% of the identified model errors in ATC tasks. By far and away the most common error type among the better performig models was so called Under-Thinking, where the models prematurely conclude that no further inference can be made, even when clear clues remain in the context. Other error types listed in the breakdwon wehere more commonly observed among models with overall worse performance, with especially smaller models struggling with following the instructions outlined in the prompt.  

## Summary
With NeedleBench Mo Li et al. present a facinating take on a synthetic and scalable reasoning and retrieval assessments framework for long context evaluation. While there are many competing long context benchmarks out there, the ATC challenge outlined in the paper presents a novel and sufficiently challenging approach to assessing a models reasoning ability in long context scenarios. Their findings highlight the general weakness of many models in this area and point out "Under-Thinking" as the main downfall of the better performing models. Their results also hint at model achitecture playing an important role in determining its reasoning ability in long context scenarios as evicenced by the performance of the Gemma series.

Being almost entirely focused on assessing reasoning ability comes at the cost of more general applicability however. Alternatives such as [LongBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14508) offer much broader coverage of potential real-world tasks and may therefore be more generally applicable if reasoning is not the primary metric to be evaluated.
